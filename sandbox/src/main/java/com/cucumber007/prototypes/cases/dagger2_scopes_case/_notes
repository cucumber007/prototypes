We have 2 activities: DaggerFirstFeatureActivity and DaggerSecondFeatureActivity
There should be 3 scopes - Application-level scope, Feature-level scope, Activity-level scope

In case those activities have been launched one after another, they can use objects from common scope.
The scope is created when user navigates to FirstActivity and destroyed when he leaves SecondActivity
(or moves backward for First)
